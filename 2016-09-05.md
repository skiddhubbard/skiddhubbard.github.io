Well, three days later on a one day assignment, I finally have that business card I was supposed to make! Definitely need
to spend a little more time using InDesign and familiarizing myself with the tools. Here's the card design:

And I might have gotten a little distracted at some point and actually started shopping for real life cards. Looking at Zazzle
for some gold foil cards!! #glitterforlife
