Still no luck today using the Project Editor for the last assignment in the CSS course. But I kept things moving by learning
a new tool, UXPin, to start working on the layout for my future site. Here's what I have so far:

The gray background will be a photo, still not quite sure what I want to put in the middle section. Definitely 
a work in progress but I can't wait to see the final result - the plan is for the site to make its debut by the end of this 
90 days. Fingers crossed!
