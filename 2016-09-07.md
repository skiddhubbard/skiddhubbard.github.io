Today was an exploration of the wonderful world of color and the psychological associations our minds have with color. 
Absolutely love this guide:

The activity today was to find three brands that use color to effectively convey their personality. Here are my picks:

Trader Joe's/Red --> Youthful and excited - I'm pretty excited when I walk into a grocery store where the employees are having fun and
wearing Hawaiian shirts!

Kashi/Green --> Health and growth - pretty much what this company is all about, using wholesome, plant-based ingredients.

PayPal/Blue --> Trust - personally, I have inadvertently come to associate this logo with trust when it comes to my payment. Given the 
option between no-name company and PayPal, I always pick PayPal. I guess the blue is working!

This exercise has also effectively made me go full circle with my personal website design. Leaning toward moving back to black and white...
