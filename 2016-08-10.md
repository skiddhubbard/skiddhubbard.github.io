Whoa, things are getting real today. Floats. I struggled a bit with floating elements while learning on Codecademy so I was
a little nervous when this lesson started. Luckily, I learned some other new concepts that helped clear things up.
First, the idea of document flow - they totally skipped over that on Codecademy. Now that I understand it, makes the weird
layouts that can happen with floating make so much more sense! With document flow in mind and learning the clear and overflow 
properties, I think I might eventually get the hang of floating. With a lot of practice, that is.

Here's the CSS:

```css
div {
    margin: 10px;
    padding: 10px;
}

#parent-div {
    background: #FFB33D;
    overflow: auto;
}

#first-div {
    border: 5px solid #4593FE;
    float: left;
    width: 175px;
    height: 100px;
}

#second-div {
    border: 5px solid #09CDA1;
    float: right;
    width: 200px;
    height: 100px;
}

#third-div {
    background: #FF605F;
    margin-bottom: 50px;
	clear: both;
}

p, h1 {
 font-family: sans-serif;   
}

h1 {
 font-size: 21px;   
}
```
