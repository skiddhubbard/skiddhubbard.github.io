Fun with fonts today! I think I could gaze at Google fonts for hours if I had the time. Today I learned how to use them
in CSS and soon I will be learning more about styling fonts and typography in my Visual Design course.
REALLY looking forward to that lesson. Here's what I created in class today:

![CSS 080716](/080716.png)

And the code:
```css
h1 {
  font-family: 'Julius Sans One';
}

h2 {
  font-family: 'Cabin Condensed';
}

p {
  font-family: 'Gentium Basic';
}
```
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<head>
  <link href='https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Julius+Sans+One' rel='stylesheet' type='text/css'>
  <link href='https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Cabin+Condensed' rel='stylesheet' type='text/css'>
  <link href='https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Gentium+Basic' rel='stylesheet' type='text/css'>
</head>

  <h1>Inventory</h1>
  <h2>By Dorothy Parker</h2>
  <p>
    Four be the things I am wiser to know: Idleness, sorrow, a friend, and a foe.
    Four be the things I'd been better without: Love, curiosity, freckles, and doubt.
    Three be the things I shall never attain: Envy, content, and sufficient champagne.
    Three be the things I shall have till I die: Laughter and hope and a sock in the eye.
  </p>
