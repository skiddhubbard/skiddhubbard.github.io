Back in action here, my two day hiatus was way too long. But don't think I wasn't learning Web Development those days -
I have been. We're on vacation but I've used the travel time to work through tutorials on PHOTOSHOP. Oh my. Learning. Curve.
Steep.

Also, my cell phone bill from using my iPhone hotspot. Ouch.

The latest and greatest work is putting my wireframe from UXPin into Photoshop to make adjustments. Crazy to see how much
more accurate the spacing and alignment is now. You can see my original wireframe peeking through behind the new Photoshop
layers below:

Next steps are coming up with a color scheme and deciding on typography. Stay tuned!
