OK, so, lessons for today:

1. Apparently the Iframes I was all jazzed about yesterday are old school. Geesh.

2. Coding is a REALLY sedentary job which leads to me spending my entire evening catching up on my FitBit steps
instead of being able to write a longer post here.

3. Meta tags aren't really all that exciting.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
    	<meta charset=”UTF-8″>
      <title>Ultimate Tech Blog</title>
    </head>
```

P.S. Promise I'll catch you up on the meeting from last night soon...
