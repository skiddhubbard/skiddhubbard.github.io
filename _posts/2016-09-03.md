Next project in the Visual Design course was to use InDesign to create a business card. I think we were technically just
supposed to use the icon we made yesterday but I couldn't bring myself to use it. Come on, I'm not actually going to use that 
on a real business card. So I think I might have jumped ahead to next week's work and I started creating a logo. 
Blood, sweat and tears went into this little guy:

Hopefully you can see the monogram in that!
