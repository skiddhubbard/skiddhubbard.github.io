Worked on the layout of the main page for the mobile version today. Developed the columns for the feed. It's coming along:

![Mobile Layout](/assets/img/092116.png)

{% highlight css%}
.feed-image {
  width: 44%;
  padding: 0 2%;
  float: left;
}

.feed-text {
  width: 44%;
  padding: 0 2%;
  float: left;
  margin-bottom: 10px;
}
{% endhighlight %}
