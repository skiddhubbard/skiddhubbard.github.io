Moving on to JavaScript arrays, methods and math today - and building a
Magic 8 Ball!

I first started by learning the basics of arrays - how to write, index, update and copy them. After a little practice with arrays, I moved on to math and learned the
Math.random() method, as well as rounding. Then it was Magic 8 Ball project time!

First, I made an array with some Magic 8 Ball answers:

{% highlight js %}
var magic8BallAnswers ["It is certain", "It is decidedly so", "Without a doubt", "Definitely", "You may rely on it", "Most likely", "Outlook good", "Signs point to yes", "Reply hazy, try again", "Ask again later", "Better not tell you now", "Cannot predict right now", "Concentrate and ask again", "Don't count on it", "My reply is no", "My sources say no", "Outlook not so good", "Very doubtful"];
{% endhighlight %}

I asked the Magic 8 Ball a question and, using the Math.random() method with rounding,
generated an answer:

The Magic 8 Ball says I can learn web development so I guess more tomorrow :)
