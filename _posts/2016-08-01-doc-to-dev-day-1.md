Ready, set, go! Today starts my personal challenge to learn Web Development.

Prior to a few weeks ago, I had zero coding knowledge. I recently began using [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/),
but found I needed more structure and repetition to solidify what I was learning.

I am currently enrolled in the Front End Developer and Visual Designer Blueprints at [Skillcrush](http://www.skillcrush.com) to hopefully
provide the additional structure; and to increase my consistency (and provide a little extra accountabiliy)
I've committed to posting an excerpt of my Web Development lessons here on GitHub.

Today's Skillcrush lesson was mostly review from Codecademy but I did learn two additional skills:
- Adding the alt tag to images
- How to open a new tab for a link in HTML

For today, I will leave you with a *lovely* Haiku:

<h3>Coding Haiku</h3>
<p>I am learning code.<br>
Pushing my brain to work hard.<br>
Practice makes perfect.</p>
