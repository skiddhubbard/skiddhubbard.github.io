Soldiering on to typography today. Another great guide to use as a quick reference:

And again, an exercise in finding three brands that use typography effectively in their brand personality:

![Typography Examples](/assets/img/typography-examples.png)

Chanel/Sans Serif --> Clean, modern, chic. What else can I say about this iconic fashion brand?

Yahoo/Display --> Fun and unique. I would say this is true for Yahoo, especially when you consider that their "top news" is generally
celebrity related.

Abott/Serif --> Reliable and respectable. If I were a medical company, this would definitely be the image I would want portrayed to my
customers.

Still leaning toward a Sans Serif for my site. It's a fine line though trying to keep it feminine. Time will tell on the final
font selections!
