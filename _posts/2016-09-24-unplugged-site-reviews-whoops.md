I was pretty happy with my stopping point yesterday, everything was working and looking pretty. So today I started going
through the other pages for the site. And I found this:

Hmmmm, think there might be a problem here.

Said problem turned out to be not closing the image tag for every image in the feed.

Fixed! I also made a few tweaks to the spacing, gave a little more breathing room around the edges. Nothing major but still
progress!
