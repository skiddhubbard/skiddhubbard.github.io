Now that I brushed up on coding for a few days, changing gears back to branding today. So far, my class tackled the basics of color, typography and personality. Now it's all about visualizing the target audience for the coffee shop project. My coffee shop is going to be geared toward the millennial generation, so here's what I came up with for this exercise:

How would I describe my brand?
An urban setting for people to have locally roasted coffee.

What is my brand's personality?
Hip, modern, relaxed, organic.

What are my brand's product offerings?
Locally roasted coffee, brewed with care for each individual’s preference.

What general needs do my products fill?
High quality coffee in a place that is fun to talk, work or grab a cup to go.

What broad groups of people relate most to those needs?
Working professionals.

What broad groups of people identify most with my brand’s personality?
Hipsters, city workers and dwellers.

What about my brand do these groups find most appealing?
Location, look and feel of the space, quality coffee.

What are their most important problems?
Balancing work with other obligations.

What are their biggest goals?
To have a great meeting spot with work colleagues or friends, being able to enjoy the time they are spending having coffee while accomplishing other tasks.

What do they value?
Their time, the environment, excellent quality products.

Where do they spend their time?
Work, home, school activities with kids; mostly in the city.

Where do they get their information?
Online - blogs, social media.
