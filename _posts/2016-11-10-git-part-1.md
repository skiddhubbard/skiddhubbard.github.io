Going on a "Git Safari" on Skillcrush the next couple of days. It's a quick
course on using the terminal, Git and GitHub. Today's lesson was on creating
branches, merging, and resolving merge conflicts.

Here's a screenshot of creating my first repository on Git using the terminal:

From there, I created a new branch to work on:

Then purposely created a merge conflict so that I will be able to identify and fix them in the future.

For fun, here's what the project looks like:
