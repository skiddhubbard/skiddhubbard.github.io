That's some pretty sweet ombre effect, huh?

And that border? I hear dashed is all the rage.

Today was all about backgrounds and borders. Feels a little 1990 but I guess you have to start at the beginning when you're
learning something new!

"Pretty" picture above brought to you by the following:

{% highlight css%}
.border-div {
  padding: 10px;
  border: 4px dotted black;
}

.color-container {
  width: 345px;
  height: 50px;
}

#color-div-1 {
  background: #2929a3;
}

#color-div-2 {
  background: #2e2eb8;
}

#color-div-3 {
  background: #3333cc;
}

#color-div-4 {
  background: #4747d1;
}

#color-div-5 {
  background: #5c5cd6;
}
{% endhighlight %}
Today was also the official start of the classes I am enrolled in. I got a jumpstart because the tutorials were available
early. Even though I have worked ahead, flipping that switch to "on" has made me start to feel the pressure! For the
remainder of the week, I will probably focus a little more on the Visual Design course because I have only worked two days
ahead, but hopefully I will still have a little CSS to share here daily. Until then, I'm off to coding dreamland...
