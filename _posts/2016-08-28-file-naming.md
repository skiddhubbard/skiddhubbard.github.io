title:  "Doc to Dev: File Naming"

Totally excited to start the Responsive Web Development course today!

Until I got started and realized this first day was going to be REALLY BORING. File naming - what a blast!!!

Although it wasn't the most exciting topic, after completing the lesson, I realized just how important it is to use best
practices and be consistent in the world of web development. One of the tasks in this lesson was to clean up and rename some
poorly written code. I learned it's definitely easier to fix or change code when you don't have to "de-code" awful naming
first.

So the moral of the story is:

1. Don't_name yourFile-this

2. Sometimes boring lessons make you a better developer.

Hopeful for more fun to come!
