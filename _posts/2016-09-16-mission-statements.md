Wow, this class is really making me dig deep. Today was writing a mission statement. Oy. I am NOT a writer. Bear with me on this exercise.

What do we do? Our coffee shop promotes local roasters and serves excellent coffee in a sophisticated but organic environment,
suitable for work or play.  
Who do we do it for? The local community; both those who roast the coffee and those who come into the shop to enjoy it.  
Why do we serve our clients or customers the way we do? We want our roasters and customers to feel like a part of a family committed
to helping the community thrive.  
How do we best serve them? By providing a place to sell goods, never cutting corners and always serving the absolute best product.  
Why are we in this industry? We care about the environment and our community, we want to provide a place to build relationships,
relax and have fun.  
Why did we start this business? We felt the need to increase gathering places in the community and also to expand the availability
of local goods.  
What is the brand image we want to convey? Welcoming, natural, relaxing, sophisticated, fun.  

MISSION STATEMENT: An outpouring of our local community -- served one cup at a time.
