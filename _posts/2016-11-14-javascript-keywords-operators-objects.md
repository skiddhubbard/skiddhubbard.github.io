Simultaneously excited and petrified to start JavaScript today! I first started
dabbling in JavaScript on Codecademy a few months back and remember feeling quite
overwhelmed. But now that I'm feeling more confident with HTML and CSS, I am ready
for the challenge!!!

This lesson started by teaching the Keywords if, else and var. It also described
the arithmetic, string, assignment, comparison and identity Operators. Then, using
JS Bin, we wrote a little code to output a specific message based on the time of
day.

Then I went on to learn about objects - how to create them in JavaScript and
using properties to define them. I also learned that a property can be a function
and in that case, they are called a method. This section also taught another
Keyword - this. Then I used all of these tools to make a chair:

And then I took some deep breaths and told myself this is allllll gonna sink
in over time, right?
