Wrapped up another week of Skillcrush with Loops - both while and for. The variable i
was also introduced as well as using a loop inside a function.

I practiced loops by saving some dalmatians with a while loop:

Then saved 101 more with a for loop:

I turned a for loop into a function and met a few Snarky Feminists on the way:

And finished up by spotting birds and using a little math:
