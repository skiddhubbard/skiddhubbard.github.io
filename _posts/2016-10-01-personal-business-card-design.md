Taking a short break from coding and my Skillcrush lessons to work on my personal projects. I'm headed to a conference for
Non-Clinical Careers in a few weeks so I worked on a business card design. I was inspired by a similar design I found on Moo
but changed the font and color to be more my style. Hoping to get it printed this week!
