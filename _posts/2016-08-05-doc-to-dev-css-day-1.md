Today the fun really started... CSS! Making the web beautiful!

I mean, take a look at this beauty:

Don't you just love that hodge-podge look going on? I know you're dying to replicate my work so here's the code:

{% highlight css %}
  h1 {
  font-family: arial;
  color: purple;
  font-weight: bold;
  font-variant: small-caps;
  text-align: center;
  text-decoration: underline;
}

h2 {
  font-family: verdana;
  color: blue;
  font-weight: bold;
  font-variant: small-caps;
  text-align: center;
}

p {
  font-family: times;
  color: green;
  text-transform: lowercase;
  word-spacing: 3px;
  line-height: 30px;
  text-indent: 10%;
}
{% endhighlight %}

For real, I promise that creation was a product of following the tutorial instructions - no judgement, please!

And finally , the run down of the meetup I went to a few nights ago. It was a really great "Tag Team" Build featuring
a Visual Designer and a Front-End Designer. During the session, they went through the process of designing and building a website for a sunglasses startup company. It was interesting to see the things I have been learning in the courses I am taking put to use in
a real world example; and also good to know that what I am learning is applicable in the industry today.

One thing I've noticed in the tech world and that the meetup reiterated for me, is the consistent desire of people the field
to share their knowledge with others. Maybe it's due to the pace at which technology evolves, or maybe they are just genuinely nice people. I don't know exactly, but it is so refreshing and it makes this uphill climb feel a little less daunting.

Maybe next meetup I'll get up the nerve to actually talk to someone. Yikes!
