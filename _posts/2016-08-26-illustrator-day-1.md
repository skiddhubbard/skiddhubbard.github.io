It was back to design for me today. I'm sure it's pretty basic material but the lessons I studied covered raster vs. vector files
and gave an overview of when to use Photoshop vs. Illustrator vs. InDesign.

I also got some practice using the tools in Illustrator by tracing the Apple logo. I used the pen tool to create bezier curves around
the apple, then used overlapping circles to create the leaf and the bite out of the side. I also FINALLY figured out how people are able
to create text around objects using the Type on a Path tool. So cool! Here's a look at the finished product:
