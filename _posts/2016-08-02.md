Day Two and back at it!

Today's work was mostly review - using div tags and nested elements. In addition, I learned some specific HTML5 tags:
+ header
+ nav
+ main
+ section
+ article
+ aside
+ footer

I also started the [Skillcrush Visual Designer Blueprint] (http://skillcrush.com/blueprint/visual-designer/).
The course began with an overview of UX/UI and went on to teach the design process including defining project goals, 
creating content strucure, user personas and sitemaps. All interesting stuff!

Here's my code for today:

```html
<div>
  <div>
    <img src="http://skillcrush.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Blog_image_get-hired-in-tech_3.jpg" width="350"/>
    <h1>How to Get Hired in Tech Blog</h1>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h2>What to Do as a Total Beginner</h2>
    <p>Getting started in a new career can be terrifying. But here are some tips to make the transition less intimidating!</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Learn some coding skills</li>
			<li>Get an awesome portfolio</li>
			<li>Make a great resume and cover letter</li>
			<li>Practice your interviewing skills</li>
		</ol>
    <p>It's a lot of work, but totally worth it in the end! If I can do it, you can do it!</p>

Until tomorrow...
